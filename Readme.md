## Welcome to LeanCreator - a lean version of Qt Creator

LeanCreator is a stripped-down version of Qt Creator, which includes the essential features for C++ (and in future possibly Oberon+ and Verilog) development, and is easy to build from source on all platforms supported by LeanQt.

LeanCreator uses [LeanQt](https://github.com/rochus-keller/LeanQt) instead of the original Qt toolkit, and is built with and uses the [BUSY build system](https://github.com/rochus-keller/BUSY) instead of qmake.

LeanCreator is based on the code of [Qt Creator 3.6.1](https://download.qt.io/archive/qtcreator/3.6/3.6.1/qt-creator-opensource-src-3.6.1.tar.gz), mostly because I already know the internals due to [VerilogCreator](https://github.com/rochus-keller/VerilogCreator/) and it's [QtcVerilog](https://github.com/rochus-keller/QtcVerilog/) IDE, and because I'm still using Qt Creator 3.4 most of the time which is efficient and does everything I need.

In combination with LeanQt this is a big codebase and as such also a good test case for the BUSY build system; the [cloc tool](http://cloc.sourceforge.net) reports 351 kSLOC for LeanCreator and 993 kSLOC for LeanQt (1.34 mmSLOC in total).

### Planned or work-in-progress features

The current version was successfully compiled and tested on Linux x86 & x86_64, macOS x86_64 & M1, and Windows x86. The tests included navigating the LeanQt source tree with different parameter settings, and running some of the examples in the debugger with breakpoints and value inspections. 
Note that the debugger on M1 doesn't work yet since the protocol of newer LLDB versions seems to be incompatible with the present version of LeanCreator.
Also note that the debugger on Windows works in principle, but the creation, naming and location of the symbol file needs further consideration.

- [x] Basic, stand-alone application with statically linked plugins
- [x] C++ support
- [x] rebranding
- [x] deep BUSY integration (instead of qmake)
- [x] GCC, Clang and MSVC support 
- [x] GDB, LLDB and CDB support 
- [ ] Extend BUSY file navigation
- [ ] Display BUSY file calculated values, gray-out inactives
- [ ] Wizzards for project and file creation
- [ ] BUSY builds with header dependency tracking
- [ ] Ninja builds
- [ ] Lua automation (instead of JS)
- [ ] Designer integration


### No support planned

- qmake
- qml, quick, JS, Python
- animation or graphics effects, all stuff not supported by LeanQt
- modeleditor
- remote access via ssh
- android, ios, qnx and winrt plugins
- make, autotools, cmake and qbs 
- version control plugins
- emacs or vim simulation

#### Precompiled versions

The following precompiled versions are available at this time:

- [Windows x86](http://software.rochus-keller.ch/leancreator_windows_x86.zip)
- [Linux x86_64](http://software.rochus-keller.ch/leancreator_linux_x64.tar.gz)
- [Mac x86_64](http://software.rochus-keller.ch/leancreator_macos_x64.zip)
- [Mac M1](http://software.rochus-keller.ch/leancreator_macos_m1.zip)

Just download, unzip and run; no installation required; it's just a single executable.

On Windows there are currently two additional DLLs which have to be copied to the same directory like the executable in case the CDB debugger is required; this will be fixed.

On Mac the terminal opens when leancreator is run, and the menus are only active if the application was in the background one time; to avoid this the application can be included in an application bundle.

### How to build LeanCreator

To build LeanCreator using LeanQt and the BUSY build system (with no other dependencies than a C++11 compiler), do the following:

1. Create a new directory; we call it the root directory here
1. Download https://github.com/rochus-keller/LeanQt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip and unpack it to the root directory; rename the resulting directory to "LeanQt".
1. Download https://github.com/rochus-keller/LeanCreator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip and unpack it to the root directory; rename the resulting directory to "LeanCreator".
1. Download https://github.com/rochus-keller/BUSY/archive/refs/heads/master.zip and unpack it to the root directory; rename the resulting directory to "BUSY".
1. Open a command line in the build directory and type `cc *.c -O2 -lm -O2 -o lua` or `cl /O2 /MD /Fe:lua.exe *.c` depending on whether you are on a Unix or Windows machine; wait a few seconds until the Lua executable is built.
1. Now type `./lua build.lua ../LeanCreator` (or `lua build.lua ../LeanCreator` on Windows); wait until the leancreator executable is built (about an hour); you find it in the output/app subdirectory.
